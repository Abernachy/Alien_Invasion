# Alien_Invasion
I'm working to learn Python and this was my first project, Alien Invasion.  It's the first project you create in Python Crash Course. 
I added my own spin on it but a lot of the code is still pulled from the book.  To run the game, just put all of the files together into one directory and run the alien_invasion.py file in your python script runner.
